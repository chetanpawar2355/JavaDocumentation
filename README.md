# Java Documentation

Javadoc is a powerful tool used to generate documentation from comments in Java source code.

## Class-level Tags:
- @author – Specifies the author of the class.
- @version – Describes the version of the class.
- @since – Indicates since which version the class or method exists.
- @see – Provides references to related classes or methods.

## Method-level Tags:
- @param – Documents method parameters.
- @return – Describes the return value of the method.
- @throws – Lists the exceptions a method can throw.
- @deprecated – Marks the method as outdated or unsafe to use.

Javadoc helps in writing clean, understandable, and maintainable code – especially useful for team collaboration and open-source projects.
